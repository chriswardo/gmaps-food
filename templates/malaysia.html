  <p>Malaysia's food scene is a mixture of traditional Malay food, Chinese, Indian, Nyonya and some fusion. Just like in Vietnam, a lot of locals eat out regularly, so the food scene is huge and there's no need to use tourist restaurants (like you might find on TripAdvisor).</p>

There is a bit of an issue with sugar here - the locals love it so much that they have problems with obesity and diabetes. The first step to avoiding the crazy levels of sugar is to learn how to ask for your drink to come without it. I always order the very cheap "teh o ais kosong" (teh = tea, o = no milk, ais = ice, kosong = no sugar).</p>
